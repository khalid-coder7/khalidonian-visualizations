# 🎥 Khalidonian – Physics & Math Visualizations

This repository contains the source code behind the animations published on my YouTube channel:  
🔗 [Khalidonian on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Khalidonian)

I create intuitive and visually engaging animations using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) to explain foundational concepts in physics and mathematics — from linear systems to the geometry of Fourier analysis.
